# SnipPeep
SnipPeep is a fast, user friendly CNV viewer

Modern genotyping methods allow the researcher to gather enormous amounts of chromosome variation
data. SnipPeep aims at providing a fast and simple graphic interface to visualise these data,
compare among subjects, and quickly query genetic databases. SnipPeep requires a moderate amount
of RAM and hard disk space, and works well on laptops.

Download the application (MacOS), convert your CNV data to SnipPeep binary format, and browse through
your different subject's chromosomes one by one, or all at once. Once you have detected an
interesting variation, click on the "browse" buttons to query the UCSC or TCAG databases to know
what is in that region.
